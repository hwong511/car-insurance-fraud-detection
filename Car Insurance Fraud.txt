Car insurance Fraud detection using image classification:

This project investigates the use of image based machine learning models to detect potential car insurance fraud using a labeled dataset
This project involves 2 different models to investigate:
- An off the shelf model 
- A model that was custom made from the ground up in R

Dataset:

The dataset also includes a training and testing split with each having 2 labels of Fraud or non-fraud. This dataset makes it ideal for building, fine-tuning, and evaluating machine learning models. 

Applications:
Car insurance fraud detection

Research in image-based anomaly detection

Educational projects in computer vision and ethics

Insurance claim validation automation

Note: The dataset supports research, analytics, and educational efforts in fraud prevention and insurance claim validation. 

Models:
